        Hi, I am a web developer and I am making this website for me. I love
        programming and designing and that is why I want to be a web developer.
        Programming languages are my favorite part of the job, I find them
        interesting and easy to learn. Web development is where my heart lies, I
        like how it challenges me in various ways. I want to be a web developer.
        One of the things that I love about being a web developer is the
        flexibility and control over your development environment. I started
        developing websites with HTML, CSS and JavaScript in my own time. That
        turned into building my first website for a friend one day, which I
        decided to open source on GitHub as I had just learned how to use Git. A
        few months after that I got offered an apprenticeship at a company where
        they would pay me while they teach me how to be a web developer –
        something that I never thought was possible before because it’s so
        expensive and most bootcamps are fulltime commitments. Not only did they
        give me the opportunity to learn about career possibilities in the
        industry but now I have job security for life.

        The whole idea of "learning to program" is a pretty broad topic. There
        are many different ways to learn programming and many resources that are
        used to teach people these skills. Programming is a language, and like
        any language, it can be learned in a few different ways. Some people may
        decide that the best way for them is to take an online class from a
        reputable school like Coursera or Udacity and learn alongside thousands
        of others at the same time. Others might find it easier if they can
        interact with real humans in real time, so they go for an in-person
        class somewhere close by their house or office. Still others might learn
        best if they have someone explain it to them one-on-one - often without
        even looking at the computer at all - so they go for a live coding
        session with someone from their local Meetup group. — Programming is a
        skill that requires dedication and practice to master. As I am learning
        how to program, I have found it can be challenging and frustrating at
        times. It is also a topic of concern for many people, who are surprised
        by my decision to learn how to code.
